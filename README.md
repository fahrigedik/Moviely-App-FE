ðŸŽ¬ Movie App - TMDB API & Custom Backend Integration
This project is a dynamic movie application where I fetch movie data directly from the TMDB API. For user reviews and comments, I've developed a custom backend that seamlessly integrates with the front end.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Blazor: For building a rich, interactive web UI.
.NET Core: Powering the backend with a robust and scalable framework.
AutoMapper: For easy object-to-object mapping, ensuring clean and maintainable code.
Blazor Interactive Server: Enabling server-side Blazor to handle real-time updates and interactions.

Feel free to explore the code, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
